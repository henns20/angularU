notes: 
1. simple app showing forms 
2. possibly decoupling 
3. no generator for this one or task runner like gulp. 
4. Use the bower tool only in thid one to get angular and other needs for front end. 
5. Goals: 1. To make it look and function like the tut or example. 2. What other things can learn from it. I was hoping ot understand the decoupling aspect to drupal and angular.
